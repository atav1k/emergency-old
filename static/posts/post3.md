Rapid response teams have been coordinating with manufacturers globally with the capacity to produce millions of NIOSH-approved N95 masks and other critical medical equipment. In the coming days and weeks, millions of units of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available for distribution.

We are working with the federal and state governments to determine where demand is and where it is most urgent. This is a tool designed to gather data as efficiently as possible to assist in distribution efforts.
